A i ) Collections in java is a framework that allows you to store and manipulate a set of objects.

Two interfaces in the collections framework include set and list.

A ii ) Byte, Short, Integer, Char, Float, Double, Boolean, Character

List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();

A iii ) Generics means that you can type cast an object into another object from its super class , for example obj t = new objsubclass();
Advantages are you can store them all in the same list for example, even though they are of a different type and also it eliminates having to cast an object into a different type


???Generics allow objects to be passed as parameters to classes, methods and interfaces. They are defined like <...>
Because java is strongly typed it allows the compiler to check if items in a collection are of the correct type. There is no need for casting when retrieving items from the collection and it avoids the ClassCastException.
