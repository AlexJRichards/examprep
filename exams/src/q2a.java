public class q2a {
    //1) You can substitute the type of variable with another type of variable eg :
    // Square sq = new Cube();
    //2) Cast sub type to super type eg :
    // Cube cu = new Cube();
    // Square sq = (Square) cu;
    //3) Downcasting is used when you want to perform some specific operation in a generalised method depending upon the subtype of object.
    // Square sq = new Cube();
    // Cube c = (cube) sq;
    // c.getHeight();
}
